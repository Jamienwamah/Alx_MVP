Advanced Calculator
This project is about an advanced calculator that Is built for the purpose of enhancing computing with the use of a speech recognition. The purpose of importing a speech recognition module is to make calculation easy for everyone including the virtually impaired. The advanced calculator is being built and well structured using the python programming language and it's helpful libraries.

Team
1 Names of the team members is stated below:
Nwamah Ikechukwu Arinze
Emmanuel Amadi
Roles Of Each Team Member:
Each team member is tasked to help in the architecture process of the advanced calculator. Ikechukwu will build psuedo code on the project while Emmanuel will help with useful ideas and tips on how we can best achieve our stated objectives. 
Why Have Those Roles Been Decided:
Well it's about team work, python advanced calculator is a creative project project, so when the two teams both perform the stated roles, each will be able to contribute effectively in making sure the project is a success as that remains the goal of the project.
2. Technologies
    1. Language in which the project will be built with will be python while the modules or libraries to be used are stated below:
    a) Tkinter
    b) Math
    c) Pygame
    d) Speech Recognition 
             The project will be built using the pycharm or the Spyder platform. Since these two platforms/Ide are python related and they also have python environment that makes it easier for python codes to effectively function
       2. A calculator can be built or developed using any choice technology, but since python is regarded as an high level language, it is the best choice, because it will help automate computing. In other for the project to be easily accessible by anyone including the visually impaired. 
3. Challenges
    1. Describe the problem the portfolio project is intended to solve: The major problem this particular project is going to solve will be based on computing for the visually impaired. Since it has a speech recognition, it would be easier for the visually impaired to simply speak on their devices any number they choose to compute and then it helps them calculate and brings out the required result. 
    2. Explain what the project will not solve: This project is strictly for computing purposes, that is it helps computing easier. So it won't solve the problems of calibration or interpolation or any other mathematical operation that doesn't require computing. 
    3. Explain who the portfolio project will help and/or the users: Like I stated, the project will be of a great advantage to the visually impaired because it will mean that they will be able to do computations as every other person can. And every user can access it. No matter the defect or sanity of the user. 
    4. Is this project relevant or dependent on a specific locale: The answer is a big no. From anywhere in the world it can be accessed and used effectively
4. Risks
    1. Describe the technical risk, potential impact and what safeguards or alternatives you have in mind: The major technical risk as to every coding project is the risk of running the code, the risk of bug. Identation error, compilation problems due to different errors including syntax error, module not found error, identation error, name error etc and the potential impact it will have on the project will be that it would hinder the compiler from being able to effectively compile the code in other for the desired function to be achieved and the alternatives will be a thorough debugging. 
    2. Describe the non-technical risk, potential impact and what strategies are in place to prevent this negative outcomes: The non-technical risk not having the right module/file not installed from the package manager, not being able to compile the program, not getting the desired output etc and the strategies in place would be to make sure that we effectively install the right python module and we also ensure that the desired output will be achieved. 
5. Infrastructure
    1. First I'll create the project repository using the project name stated earlier, then I'll add my team mate as a collaborator so that when he clones my repo, he will also be allowed to make changes on the repo as at when due. For the purpose of this project, we will maintain the same branch(which is the main branch)
